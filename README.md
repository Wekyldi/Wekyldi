Finding inspiration on GitHub

You can find inspiration for your own projects and learning on GitHub and connect with a community.
In this article

Introduction

GitHub is a vast open-source community. You can explore GitHub to find interesting repositories, topics, code, people, and organizations that can inspire your own work, or support your own learning.

Once you've found something that interests you, you can:

    Star the repository or topic, so you can easily find it again later.
    Follow people or organizations, so you can stay updated on their activities.
    Download useful repositories or code, and customize it for your own use.
    Contribute to another user's project, by opening a pull request.

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your personal dashboard.
Visit Explore GitHub

    Navigate to Explore GitHub.
    Browse popular repositories and topics.
    Click 

    Star next to repositories and topics that interest you, so you can easily find them again later.
    Navigate to your stars page to see all your starred repositories and topics.

Search for a topic or project on GitHub

    Navigate to https://github.com/search.
    Type a keyword or query into the search bar. For example, try "green software tools." For more detailed information about searching for specific topics, repositories, or code, see About searching on GitHub.
    Use the left sidebar to filter the results. For example, to browse all repositories in the "green-software" topic, search "green-software", then filter by "Topic".
